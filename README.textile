h1. json-log4j-layout


I started this project because I needed a fast way to export Log4j events into JSON
as part of my elasticflume project (https://github.com/tallpsmith/elasticflume).

I was a bit surprised to not easily Google an existing one, so if you do know of one
that's awesome, by all means let me know..

I needed this one to be fast, and I believe Jackson is a very fast JSON renderer.

h2. HowToBuild


This project uses mvn, just type:

<pre>
   mvn package
</pre>

and inside the "target" directory will be the JAR.

h2. HowToUse


* Configure this Layout as you would normally in log4j with the classname org.elasticflume.log4j.JSONLayout
* If you use Log4j's MDC (and really you should!) then add a parameter block to configure
 the set of MDC keys you wish to export in this layout (CSV format for the keys)

<pre>

 <param name="MdcsToUse" value="UserId,ProjectId,RequestId" />

</pre>

TODO
====

* Currently does NOT export locationInformation
* I have not yet exported this Maven project to the OSS Sonatype Release repository for easy dependency Management for people
